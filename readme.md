# Djenterator

This tool generates fake guitar tabs that aim to humorously imitate the guitar sound incorporated
in typical djent songs. The "songs" folder contains examples of tabs generated by this tool.

It uses only two notes on the widest string of a traditional guitar, 0 and 1 - the open string,
and the first fret - along with a variety of strumming patterns (muting, tremolo, hammer-ons/
pull- offs etc) to create random-ish rhythms that still represent all the things you might hear
in a djent song, only exaggerated for comic value.

To use this tool, you can simply download the Python source, place it any-
where, and run it on the command line via:

`python path/to/file/djenterator.py`

and it will create a "songs" folder in the current directory, containing the
tabs it just generated.

Additional features that might be added to future releases of the generator itself are described
in Issue #1 (but they will not be added quite yet). If you know djent, feel free to add what you'd
like to see, too.

Happy djenterating!
