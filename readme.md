# Djenterator

A toy djent song generator in Python. The "songs" folder contains examples of tabs generated by this tool.

For each tab, the tool generates the following:
- 0's
- 1's
- palm-muted and not-muted notes
- hammer-ons, pull-offs (incl. to/from muted notes)
- tabs for 9-string guitars by default
- triplet, quadruplet, etc. patterns

Additional features that might be added to future releases of the generator itself are described in Issue 1 (but they will not be added quite yet). If you know djent, feel free to add what you'd like to see, too!
